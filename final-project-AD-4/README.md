# Final Project

## Domain of Interest: Electric Vehicles

### Why we are interested
Transport emissions are one of the largest causes of air pollution. On September 23rd, 2020, California governor signed a history-making executive order: the state will ban the sales of new gas-powered cars within the next 15 years to fight against climate change. This order directs the state to reduce fossil fuel emissions by transitioning to the use of more eco-friendly and sustainable transportation.
Over the last year, the stock price of Tesla, the leading enterprise in the EV(electronic vehicle) field, has increased by 500%. This indicates that the public has paid more attention to the EV industry field. From the data available, we would like to study what affects the EV sales.

### Data-driven questions

1. Does petrol price affect EV sales?
- We will be comparing the data from two files, one that contains information on petrol prices and another that has information of EV sales, to determine if changes in petrol prices affect EV sales.
2. Will EV sales keep increasing in the next few years and eventually replace gasoline-powered vehicles in the future?
- We will be analyzing the number of EV and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) sales in the US PEV Sales by Model dataset to see if there is an upward trend.
3. When it comes to each brand who manufactures EV, is range one of the determinants of its sales?
- We will be using the Visualizing the Range of EV on Major Highway Routes dataset to analyze the range factor.


## Finding Data

### 1. [EV sales by model](https://www.anl.gov/es/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates)
- **How the data was collected:**
	This data is from Argonne National Laboratory, a science and engineering lab operated by the University of Chicago for the US Department of Energy.  The data was collected from various sources, including JD Power, Green Car Congress, Hybrid Market Dashboard, and was compiled by Argonne.  The data concerns the sales of electric vehicles in the US, with data beginning in 2011 and running through the present.
- **Number of rows:** 55
- **Number of columns:** 10
- **Question answered:** Will EV sales keep increasing in the next few years and eventually replace gasoline-powered vehicles in the future?

### 2. [Visualizing the Range of EV on Major Highway Routes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/)
- **How the data was collected:** This data is collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and from vehicle manufacturers, and is visualized by Visual Capitalist.  The data concerns the range and cost of various electric vehicles on the market today, with special attention paid to their cost per mile driven.
- **Number of rows:** 26
- **Number of columns:** 4
- **Question answered:** When it comes to each brand that manufactures EV, is range one of the determinant of its sales?

### 3. [U.S. Gasoline Retail Price](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=M)
- **How the data was collected:** The data is from the US Energy Information Administration.  It tracks the retail price of gasoline in the US, beginning in September of 1990.  The data is updated weekly.
- **Number of rows:** 362
- **Number of columns:** 2
- **Question answered:** Does the petrol price affect EV sales?
